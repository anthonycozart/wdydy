    "Podcasts. There are millions of them. Some might say too many. I have one already. I don't have any because there are enough.",
    "Politics, business, sport, you name it, there's a podcast about it. They all ask the big questions and cover the hot topics of the day.",
    "But nobody is covering the most important topic of all.",
    "Why is that? Are they scared? Too afraid of being censored by the man? Possibly, but not us.",
    "We're here to ask the only question that matters. We try and say it at the same time, Max.",
    "That's it. All we're interested in is what the guests got up to yesterday. Nothing more.",
    "Day before yesterday, Max? Nope.",
    "The greatest and most interesting day of your life? Unless it was yesterday, we don't want to know about it."
